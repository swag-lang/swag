        <h2>A sophisticated toy</h2>
        <p class="mb-3">Swag is a system programming language made for fun because, let's be honest, C++ is now an horrible and ugly beast !</p>
        <p>This is my third compiler (the other ones were developed for AAA game engines), but that one is by far the most advanced.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Native or interpreted</h2>
        <p class="mb-3">The Swag compiler can generate fast **native** code, or act as an interpreter for a **scripting** language.</p>
        <p>Imagine C++, but where everything could be *constexpr*.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Modern</h2>
        <p class="mb-3">Swag has type reflection at both runtime and compile time, meta programmation, generics, a powerful macro system...</p>
        <p>**Enjoy.**</p>
