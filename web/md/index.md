# Description
Swag is a native and/or interpreted programming language made for fun because, let's be honest, C++ is now an horrible and ugly beast ! This is my third compiler (the other ones were developed for AAA game engines), but that one is by far the most advanced.

[Getting Started](getting_started.php)

[Scripting](swag_as_script.php)

If you want to take a look at the language, this is [here](language.php).

If you want to take a look at the standard list of modules, this is [here](std.php).
