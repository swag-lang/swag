/**
This 'swag/bin/reference/language' module is a short explanation of the Swag language, the basic syntax and usage.
It will only describe the language itself, without the need of the Swag standard libraries (Std).

Things like dynamic arrays, dynamic strings, hash maps and so on are written in the 'Std.Core' module, so
you won't find them in the examples to come.

As 'reference/language' is written as a test module, you can run it with 'swag run -w:/reference'
