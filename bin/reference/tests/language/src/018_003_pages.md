In `Swag.DocKind.Pages` mode, each file generates an individual webpage, with the page name matching the file name. Aside from this distinction, the behavior is consistent with that of `Swag.DocKind.Examples` mode.

# File Naming and Page Generation

Each file in this mode generates a separate webpage. The page name will directly correspond to the file name.
  
# Use Case

`Swag.DocKind.Pages` mode is particularly useful for generating individual web pages, as demonstrated in the [example directory](https://github.com/swag-lang/swag/tree/master/bin/reference/tests/web). This mode is ideal for creating standalone pages that can be linked together or accessed independently, making it a versatile option for web-based documentation projects.
