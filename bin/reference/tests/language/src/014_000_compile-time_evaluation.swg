/**
One of the most powerful features of Swag is its ability to execute **everything** at compile-time.
This capability allows Swag to function not only as a compiled language but also as a scripting
language, where the compiler effectively acts as an interpreter. This flexibility enables developers
to leverage compile-time execution for tasks that traditionally require runtime evaluation,
resulting in more efficient and versatile code.
