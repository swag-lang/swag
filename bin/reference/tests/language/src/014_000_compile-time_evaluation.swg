/**
# 'Compile-Time Execution in Swag'

One of Swag’s most powerful features is its ability to execute **everything**
at compile time. This means Swag can function both as a compiled language
and as a scripting language, with the compiler acting as an interpreter.

This flexibility allows developers to perform tasks at compile time that
would otherwise require runtime computation — resulting in more efficient,
expressive, and versatile programs.
