/**
# Type Alias
A `typealias` allows you to create a shorthand for an existing type, making it possible to refer to that type using a new, potentially more descriptive name. This can enhance code clarity, reduce repetition, and make complex types easier to work with.
*/

/**
# Basic Type Alias
Using `typealias`, you can define an alias for an existing type. This alias can then be used in place of the original type, simplifying the code or improving its readability. Itâ€™s important to note that a type alias does not create a new type but merely provides an alternative name for an existing one.

    @assert(Color.G == 1)                   // 'Color' can be used wherever 'RGB' is expected.

/**
# Aliasing Primitive Types
You can create aliases for primitive types, making your code more readable and meaningful, especially when the alias represents a specific domain concept.

/**
# Strict Type Alias
In cases where you need to enforce type safety, Swag provides the `Swag.Strict` attribute, which can be applied to a `typealias`. This makes the alias a distinct type, preventing implicit casting between the alias and the original type. Explicit casting is still allowed, but the distinct type ensures that operations requiring type specificity are clear and deliberate.
*/
#test
{
    #[Swag.Strict]
    typealias MyType = s32                  // 'MyType' is a distinct type, not interchangeable with 's32'
    #assert @typeof(MyType) != s32

/**
# Name Alias
A `namealias` allows you to create an alternative name or shortcut for functions, variables, or namespaces. This can be particularly useful for simplifying code, managing long or complex names, or improving the readability and maintainability of your code.
*/

/**
# Function Name Alias
With `namealias`, you can define a shorter or more convenient name for a function. This is particularly helpful when dealing with functions that have long or descriptive names, allowing you to simplify your code without sacrificing functionality.

}

/**
# Variable and Namespace Alias
`namealias` can also be used to alias variables and namespaces, offering a shorter or more convenient reference that can be used throughout your code. This is particularly useful in large codebases where certain variables or namespaces are frequently referenced.
*/
