/**
# 'Compile-Time Source Code Generation'

Swag allows you to construct and inject source code dynamically at compile time.
The code is provided as a **string** containing valid Swag syntax, which the
compiler then parses and integrates into the final program.

This feature enables powerful metaprogramming patterns â€” you can generate,
modify, or extend code during compilation, reducing duplication and creating
highly flexible, adaptive programs.
