/**
Swag provides the ability to construct and inject source code at compile time. 
This powerful feature allows you to dynamically generate code based on compile-time 
conditions or inputs, and have that code seamlessly integrated into the final program. 
The source code is supplied as a **string**, and it must be a valid Swag program.

This technique opens up possibilities for advanced metaprogramming, where code can 
be generated, modified, or extended during the compilation process, reducing redundancy 
and enabling more flexible, adaptive programs.
