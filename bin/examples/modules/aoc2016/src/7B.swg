/*
--- Part Two ---
You would also like to know which IPs support SSL (super-secret listening).

An IP supports SSL if it has an Area-Broadcast Accessor, or ABA, anywhere in the supernet sequences (outside any square bracketed sections), and a corresponding Byte Allocation Block, or BAB, anywhere in the hypernet sequences. An ABA is any three-character sequence which consists of the same character twice with a different character between them, such as xyx or aba. A corresponding BAB is the same characters but in reversed positions: yxy and bab, respectively.

For example:

aba[bab]xyz supports SSL (aba outside square brackets with corresponding bab within square brackets).
xyx[xyx]xyx does not support SSL (xyx, but no corresponding yxy).
aaa[kek]eke supports SSL (eke in supernet with corresponding kek in hypernet; the aaa sequence is not related, because the interior character must be different).
zazbz[bzb]cdb supports SSL (zaz has no corresponding aza, but zbz has a corresponding bzb, even though zaz and zbz overlap).
How many IPs in your puzzle input support SSL?
