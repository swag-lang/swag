/*
'Std.Audio' is a module to decode and play sound files.
Under windows, it is based on the 'xaudio2' library.
# How to play a sound
First, you have to initialize the audio engine by calling [[Audio.createEngine]].
```swag
Audio.createEngine()
defer Audio.destroyEngine() // Don't forget to destroy the engine when you are done
```
You then have to load a sound file.
```swag
let soundFile = Audio.SoundFile.Load("mySound.wav")
```
Note that by default, the sound file will load all of its datas in memory. If you want the sound to be loaded only when played, set 'loadDatas' to false.
```swag
let soundFile = Audio.SoundFile.Load("mySound.wav", loadDatas = false)
```
Once you have a sound file, the simplest way to play it is by calling [[Voice.play]]. The sound will be played once, until the end, and will be destroyed.
```swag
Voice.play(soundFile)
```
To have more control, you could also use [[Voice.create]] then [[Voice.Play]] on the created sound. That way you will recieve a [[Voice]] object you can play with.
```swag
let voice = Voice.create(&soundFile)
voice.setVolume(0.5)
voice.play(Loop)
```
